# Half Helix Technical Challenge

### Notes

My lazy loader will take all images and preload them as triggered by the `IntersectionObserver`.

**Problem**

For any given image block, there are two images that need to be lazy loaded (front and back), both `<img>` need to be loaded onto the DOM for the lazy loader to work. The `v-if` and `v-else` directives only allow a single element to be loaded at a time. This messes with the lazy loader as preloading is only triggered through the intersection observer.

**Solution 1**

Using `v-show` instead, and having both images lazy load with the secondary image underbeath the main image (CSS) will allow preloading of both assets through the `IntersectionObserver`

But another problem occurs - `v-show` toggles the css class display to `display: none` and because the secondary image is loaded underneath the main image (`position: absolute & z-index: -1`), the product information will end up displaying on top of the secondary image. I would need to code a custom directive called `v-visible` to toggle the opacity rather than the display property for this to work

**Solution 2**

In my final solution, I decided to opt for a class toggle in order to toggle the opacity property instead of the display property. One caveat is that the vue transitions wonâ€™t work because it is only triggered through conditional rendering (v-if) or conditional display (v-show)
